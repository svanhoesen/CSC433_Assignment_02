

1) What is a pixel? How big is a pixel? Both of these questions have multiple answers, briefly explain yours.



2) 3 Ã— 3 convolution kernels can create a variety of effects. Consider the following three kernels. Briefly describe 
   the output image that is produced as a result of convolution with each kernel (you may assume each are scaled
   as necessary):

    a. [[0  1  0]
		[0  0  0]
		[0  0  0]]

    b. [[1  2  1]
		[1  2  1]
		[1  2  1]]
	
    c. [[0  -1  0]
		[-1  4 -1]
		[0  -1  0]]
	
3) Given an image I of 200x50, and a kernel K of size 5x5, how many multiplications are required to compute K*I? Be sure to state your
   boundary condition.



4) Draw and label a diagram of the HSV color space. Include a brief description of each variable, its role in the final
   color, and a possible numeric range.



5) In rescaling images, individually adjusting only gain or bias typically is not sufficient to improve the image. Explain
   why we need both. In particular, discuss the resulting effects on the image when adjusting gain vs. bias.
